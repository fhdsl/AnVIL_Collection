## Courses and Guides {-}

### What is needed to list my repository? {-}

The AnVIL Collection workflow uses three important things to add courses to the Collection. These are the repository **description**, **homepage**, and **topics** tags. Repositories must be set to public to be listed in the Collection.

### How often is the Collection updated? {-}

The collection is rendered nightly between 3am and 5am EST.

### How can I add my new course/content to the Collection? {-}

Your repository must be created under the jhudsl or fhdsl organizations and meet the above criteria. The repository must also have the tag `anvil` or `gdscn`.

For repositories under other organizations, you can fork the repository into the jhudsl or fhdsl organizations. [Example](https://github.com/fhdsl/Data-Wrangling)

### I want to use the raw Collection data! {-}

You can use the following link:

### How do I edit **description**, **homepage**, and **topics**? {-}

#### Where to edit {-}

Start by clicking the gear button on the top right of the repository page on GitHub next to "About".

#### Edit repository description {-}

Enter a concise description, for example "A guide for instructors using AnVIL for workshops, lessons, or courses."

#### Edit repository homepage {-}

Make sure you link to the website where your course is being rendered. For example, this repository links to https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Instructor_Guide.

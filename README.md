[![Render Bookdown and Coursera](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/actions/workflows/render-all.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template/actions/workflows/render-all.yml)

This site was created from [the AnVIL Template](https://github.com/jhudsl/AnVIL_bookdown_style), which is based on [the OTTR Template](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template)

### What is the AnVIL Collection?

AnVIL Collection uses the Github API to gather jhudsl and fhdsl organization repositories that we have worked on. It renders the table in a markdown-readable format on the [website](https://hutchdatascience.org/DaSL_Collection).

### What repositories are included?

The Collection only includes repositories that meet the following criteria:

-   Are public
-   Have a homepage listed
-   Have a description listed
-   Have "anvil" and/or "gdscn" as tags

### How often is the Collection updated?

The collection is rendered nightly at 3am EST.

### How can I add my new course/content to the AnVIL Collection?

Your repository must be created under the jhudsl or fhdsl organizations and meet the above criteria. For more information see the [Contribute](https://hutchdatascience.org/AnVIL_Collection/contribute.html) section.

For repositories under other organizations, you can fork the repository into the jhudsl or fhdsl organizations. [Example](https://github.com/fhdsl/Data-Wrangling)
